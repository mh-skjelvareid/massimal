# The existence of this file indicates that the containing folder is a Python
# package. The file can also contain python code.
# See https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#regular-packages
#
# To add the package to the Python search path (in case the package directory is
# not a subdirectory of the main project file), you can add to the Python path at
# runtime (a "hack", avoid if possible):
# 	import sys
# 	sys.path.append(/path/to/package)
#
# If working in Linux, the path to the package can also be added by modifying
# the .bashrc file in the home directory (cleaner):
#   export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/module
#
# See https://bic-berkeley.github.io/psych-214-fall-2016/sys_path.html for a
# nice explanation of how modules and paths are handled.
#
# The module can also be made available for import by creating a Python package.
# See  https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/ for more.
