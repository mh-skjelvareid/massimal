# Massimal dropcam observations dataset (boat)
This file is a description of a dataset with underwater video and geotagged images
collected by towing a camera from a boat. The remainder of the file describes the
research project that collected the data, the camera equipment used, and the data format.

## The MASSIMAL research project 
This dataset was collected as part of the "MASSIMAL" project (Mapping of Algae and
Seagrass using Spectral Imaging and Machine Learning). The project was conducted in the
period 2020-2024, and data collection and field work was performed at various locations
along the Norwegian coast in the period 2021-2023. 

The project was financed by the Norwegian Research Council (8 MNOK) and by UiT the
Arctic University of Norway (600 kNOK), and was a collaboration between 

- UiT the Arctic University of Norway ("UiT")
- Norwegian Institute for Water Research ("NIVA")
- Nord University ("Nord")

The following researchers were the main contributors to the project:

- Martin Hansen Skjelvareid (principal investigator), UiT
- Katalin Blix, UiT
- Eli Rinde, NIVA
- Kasper Hancke, NIVA
- Maia RÃ¸st Kile, NIVA
- Galice Guillaume Hoarau, Nord

## Drop-camera
The drop camera was a camera custom-built by NIVA, enabling live streaming of video via
a cable to a monitor in the boat. The camera also had a built-in depth sensor. 

The camera was used to observe the seafloor an a number of observation points. The
camera was lowered down to the seafloor and field notes regarding depth, substrate and
aquatic vegetation were made. 

The position of each observation point was logged using a handheld GPS device with a
positional accuracy of a few meters. Wind, current and camera drift add to the
uncertainty of the observation position. The overall accuracy is on the order of 10
meters. 

After field work, the positions and field notes were formatted and saved as a
"shapefile" and/or an Excel workbook.
