Short description of Massimal dataset published on NIRD Research data archive

(The short description field does not support headings, spaces etc. A very short
description is given here, with a more detailed description given in a separate readme
MarkDown file.)

The MASSIMAL dataset contains data from shallow coastal areas collected using multiple
data modalities, such as hyperspectral and multispectral aerial imaging, underwater
imaging, and sonar measurements. The dataset was collected at four main locations along
the Norwegian coast, in the time period 2021-2023, spanning large variations in habitat
types. The data is organized as a set of ZIP files, with each file corresponding to one
single time, location, and data type. Annotations of hyperspectral images are also
included in the dataset. Potential applications of the dataset include development of
mapping methods for coastal habitats based, education on coastal monitoring methods, and
reference material for timeline studies. See the massimal_dataset_readme.md for a more
comprehensive introduction to the dataset, and
massimal_detailed_readme_every_modality.zip for a collection of readme files for every
data modality.
