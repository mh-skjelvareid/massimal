# Massimal sonar dataset
This file is a description of a dataset with video of the seafloor collected using a
remoted operated vehicle (ROV). The dataset was collected in 2022 in a location close to
the island of Vega in Norway, as part of a research project. Even though the research
project spanned multiple locations and research campaigns, the ROV was only once. The
remainder of the file describes the research project, the ROV used, and details
regarding the transects that the ROV covered.

## The MASSIMAL research project 
This dataset was collected as part of the "MASSIMAL" project (Mapping of Algae and
Seagrass using Spectral Imaging and Machine Learning). The project was conducted in the
period 2020-2024, and data collection and field work was performed at various locations
along the Norwegian coast in the period 2021-2023. 

The project was financed by the Norwegian Research Council (8 MNOK) and by UiT the
Arctic University of Norway (600 kNOK), and was a collaboration between 

- UiT the Arctic University of Norway ("UiT")
- Norwegian Institute for Water Research ("NIVA")
- Nord University ("Nord")

The following researchers were the main contributors to the project:

- Martin Hansen Skjelvareid (principal investigator), UiT
- Katalin Blix, UiT
- Eli Rinde, NIVA
- Kasper Hancke, NIVA
- Maia RÃ¸st Kile, NIVA
- Galice Guillaume Hoarau, Nord

## ROV
The ROV was a [Fifish V6 Expert](https://www.qysea.com/products/fifish-v6-expert/),
manufactured by Qysea and owned by [SeaBee](https://seabee.no/). The ROV has a 4K
camera, and depth, temperature and date information is overlayed directly on the video
image.   

## Transect end point position measurement
The ROV was placed in the water from a boat, was piloted down to the seafloor, and drove
in (more or less) a straight line along the seafloor, for as far as practically
possible. The ROV was then piloted back to the surface and picked up. The start and end
points were measured with a handheld GPS device, resulting in a positional accuracy of a
few meters. 

In some locations the ROV followed a pre-placed transect marked by a rope or measuring
tape, but in most locations not transect markers were used.
