# Massimal seafloor imaging dataset (snorkeling)
This file is a description of a dataset with images and/or video of the seafloor in
shallow areas, recorded while snorkeling in the water surface along pre-planned transects. The description is general and not connected to one specific location or
dataset. The remainder of the file describes the research project that collected the
data, the method used for making transects, and the method for imaging while snorkeling.

## The MASSIMAL research project 
This dataset was collected as part of the "MASSIMAL" project (Mapping of Algae and
Seagrass using Spectral Imaging and Machine Learning). The project was conducted in the
period 2020-2024, and data collection and field work was performed at various locations
along the Norwegian coast in the period 2021-2023. 

The project was financed by the Norwegian Research Council (8 MNOK) and by UiT the
Arctic University of Norway (600 kNOK), and was a collaboration between 

- UiT the Arctic University of Norway ("UiT")
- Norwegian Institute for Water Research ("NIVA")
- Nord University ("Nord")

The following researchers were the main contributors to the project:

- Martin Hansen Skjelvareid (principal investigator), UiT
- Katalin Blix, UiT
- Eli Rinde, NIVA
- Kasper Hancke, NIVA
- Maia Røst Kile, NIVA
- Galice Guillaume Hoarau, Nord

## Transect marking
Defined transects were marked on the seafloor before imaging. Straight transect lines
were marked using thin white polyester rope, or fiberglass measuring tape. The ends of
the transect were fastened with bamboo poles hammered into the sand, or with polyester
shopping bags filled with stones. Most transects had markers along them at every 5 or 10
meters, for example black markings on the rope or rubber disks fastened with plastic
strips. These were "milestones" to determine the relative position along the transect.
In some cases these markings are also visible in drone images taken from above the
water.   

## Transect end point position measurement
The end points of transects in the intertidal zone or in very shallow water was measured using
high-accuracy GNSS (Trimble Catalyst or Leica GS14T), with an accuracy of a few cm.
In deeper water, transect end points were harder to measure accurately. The following
method was used:

- Driving a boat close to the transect, until the end point was seen
- Gliding slowly towards the end point
- Using a handheld GPS device to record a waypoint when passing over the end point.

The accuracy of this method is on the order of a few meters.

## Underwater imaging while snorkeling
A number of different cameras were used to image the seafloor while snorkeling. In
datasets from Juvika and Sandsund close to Bodø, a (**fill in camera model**) was used.
The camera was operated handheld, close to the water surface. In datasets from Larvik
and Vega, a GoPro camera was used. The camera was mounted to a wooden pole, 1-4 meters
long, using a GoPro "Large Tube Mount". The pole enabled the camera operator to lower
the camera closer to the seafloor while snorkeling, thus improving the visibility in the
camera images where the water was deeper.
